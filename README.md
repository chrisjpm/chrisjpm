### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris (he/him) and I am currently in my 3rd year studying Artifical Intelligence and Computer Science at The University of Edinburgh. I enjoy website development, as well as UI/UX design. I've been a competitive swimmer for over a decade and swim with the uni.

- :pushpin: I'm currently working on 2 pieces of coursework (pvt. until permitted to be public) and a group project ([DeliverED Home](https://github.com/DeliverED-Home))
- :mag: Take a look through my repos to view projects and coursework completed at uni. Some must be kept private in respect to the courses' policies.
  - View my most recent: [Informatics Large Practical (CW2)](https://github.com/cpuved/inf3-ilp-cw2), achieving 96% (a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one)
- :mailbox_with_mail: DM me on any of my socials to ask questions! [ Discord: cpu#8729 â€¢ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chris_jpm) â€¢ [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cpudev) â€¢ [Email](mailto:chrispercevalmaxwell@gmail.com) â€¢ [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/chris-jpm) ]
- :floppy_disk: Download my CV <a href="https://github.com/cpuved/CV/raw/main/CV_CPM.pdf">here</a>!
