### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris (he/him) and I am currently in my 3rd year studying Artifical Intelligence and Computer Science at The University of Edinburgh. I enjoy website development, as well as UI/UX design. I've been a competitive swimmer for over a decade and swim with the University.


- :pushpin: I'm currently working on 2 pieces of coursework and a group project - [DeliverED Home](https://github.com/DeliverED-Home)
- :mag: Take a look through my repos to view past coursework completed at uni. Some must be kept private in respect to the courses' policies.
- :mailbox_with_mail: DM me on any of my socials to ask questions! [ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cpudev) â€¢ [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cpudev) â€¢ Discord: cpu#8729 ]
