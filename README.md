### Hello 👋

I'm Chris (he/him) and I am currently in my 3rd year studying Artifical Intelligence and Computer Science at The University of Edinburgh. I enjoy website development, as well as UI/UX design. I've been a competitive swimmer for over a decade and swim with Edinburgh University.


* :satellite: I'm currently working on 2 pieces of coursework and a group project - [DeliverED Home](https://github.coom/DeliverED-Home)
* :telescope: Take a look through my repos to view past coursework completed at uni. Some must be kept private in respect to the course's policies.
